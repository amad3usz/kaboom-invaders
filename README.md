# Kaboom Invaders
This is a game I built for a Mintbean hackathon. I used primarily JavaScript and the KaboomJS library to create it. This game is essentially a Space Invaders remake with a few little extras. The graphics were created by myself, but heavily inspired by others' work (I'm not that creative). The sound effects and music were found on freesound.org, with the exception of the explosion sound effect, which was borrowed from a KaboomJS example.
